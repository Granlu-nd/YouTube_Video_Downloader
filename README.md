# Youtube_Video_Downloader
My first python project that downloads a YouTube video and gives the stats on the video.

To use: 
1. Copy the URL of the video you want to download to your computer.
2. Run the main file in the windows terminal.
3. Type, 'python main.py "𝘝𝘪𝘥𝘦𝘰 𝘜𝘙𝘓" then press enter.
4. The program will then start, first giving a quick welcom then asking the user if they
would like to see the video stats (Wich are the, Title, Number of Views, Creator, Video length in seconds, and any Keywords the video has)
if the user says no, they will then be asked if they would like to download the video.
5. If the user says yes when asked to downlaod they will then be prompted to enter the folder destitantion they would like, if nothing is enterd a new folderwill be created.
6. If the user says no, the message, "OK! Have a good day." will appaer.
